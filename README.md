# WIFIPassword
This Python script is using the subprocess module to interact with the system’s command line interface. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

Import subprocess: The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.

Get WiFi profiles: The script runs the command netsh wlan show profiles in the command line and collects its output. This command lists all the WiFi profiles saved on your computer.

Parse WiFi profiles: The output of the command is then parsed to extract the names of the WiFi profiles.

Get password for each profile: For each WiFi profile, the script runs the command netsh wlan show profile name=<profile_name> key=clear. This command displays detailed information about a specific wireless profile, including the plaintext password under the ‘Key Content’ field.

Parse passwords: The output of each command is parsed to extract the ‘Key Content’ field, which contains the password of the WiFi network.

Print WiFi names and passwords: Finally, it prints out each WiFi profile name along with its corresponding password. If a password isn’t found, it prints an empty string.
